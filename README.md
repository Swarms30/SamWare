To run this program, run the main.py file in the src folder. The files to be processed go in the to_be_processed folder. Note that the uploadToDrive.py file uploads the files to Google Drive after they are processed, but this step is optional. If the Google authentication window is closed, the files will still appear in the processed folder (they can be dragged from the processed folder in finder to Google Drive).
