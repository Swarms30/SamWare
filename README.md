To run this program, use the .venv virtual Python environment to run main.py in the src folder. The files to be processed go in the to_be_processed folder. Note that the uploadToDrive.py file uploads the files to Google Drive after they are processed, but this step is optional. If the authentication window is closed, the files will still appear in the processed folder (they can be dragged from the processed folder in finder to Google Drive).

The easiest way to use the virtual environment is by opening this project in Visual Studio Code and running the main.py file there after selecting the virtual environment (command+shift+P then select environment).
